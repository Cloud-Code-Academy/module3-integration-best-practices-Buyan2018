# Cloud Code Academy - Integration Developer Program
## Lesson 2: Exchange Rate API Integration - Best Practices

Welcome to the second lesson of the Integration Developer program! In this lesson, you'll build a complete Salesforce integration with an external API, implementing best practices for secure authentication, data processing, and automated scheduling.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Configure Named Credentials to securely store API authentication details
- Create wrapper classes to deserialize JSON API responses
- Implement a service layer for making API callouts
- Build a scheduled job to automate integration updates
- Apply best practices for error handling and testing

## üìã Exercise Overview

This exercise contains several components:

1. **ExchangeRateService.cls**
   - Service class with methods for API callouts
   - Handles communication with the ExchangeRate-API
   - Located in `force-app/main/default/classes/`

2. **ExchangeRateWrapper.cls**
   - Wrapper class for JSON deserialization
   - Maps API response to Apex objects
   - Located in `force-app/main/default/classes/`

3. **ExchangeRateScheduler.cls**
   - Scheduler for automated updates
   - Implements the Schedulable interface
   - Located in `force-app/main/default/classes/`

4. **Supporting Classes**:
   - `ExchangeRateMock.cls` - Mock HTTP class for testing
   - `ExchangeRateServiceTest.cls` - Test class for the service
   - `ExchangeRateSchedulerTest.cls` - Test class for the scheduler

5. **Custom Object**:
   - `Exchange_Rate__c` - Custom object for storing exchange rates

## üî® Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Deploy the code to your Salesforce org using:
   ```bash
   sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/default
   ```
3. Set up Named Credentials for the ExchangeRate-API (instructions below)

## üîë Named Credential Setup

1. In Salesforce Setup, navigate to **Security > Named Credentials**
2. Click **New Named Credential**
3. Configure with the following settings:
   - Label: ExchangeRate API
   - Name: ExchangeRate_API
   - URL: https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v6
   - Identity Type: Named Principal
   - Authentication Protocol: No Authentication
4. Save the configuration

## ‚úçÔ∏è Exercise Instructions

1. **Implement ExchangeRateWrapper.cls**
   - Create classes to deserialize the JSON response from the API
   - Map API data to Salesforce fields

2. **Complete ExchangeRateService.cls**
   - Implement methods to make callouts to the API
   - Process the response and create/update Exchange_Rate__c records
   - Add proper error handling

3. **Finish ExchangeRateScheduler.cls**
   - Implement the execute method to run the service
   - Set up proper scheduling using CRON expressions

4. **Test Your Implementation**
   - Run the provided test classes to verify your code
   - Ensure all tests pass with proper coverage

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your implementation should:
- Pass all test methods in the provided test classes
- Properly deserialize JSON responses
- Create or update Exchange_Rate__c records
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Schedule updates to run automatically
- Follow Salesforce best practices

## üí° Tips

- Review the API documentation at [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/overview)
- Use the Developer Console debug logs to troubleshoot
- Test with mock responses before making actual API calls
- Pay attention to error handling for various scenarios

- [Apex Testing Best Practices](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_testing_best_practices.htm)

## üèÜ Challenge

Once you've completed the basic implementation, try these challenges:
1. Add support for multiple base currencies
2. Create a Lightning component to display current exchange rates
3. Implement custom logging to track integration activity
4. Use External Credentials instead of Named Credentials for enhanced security
